# Machine-Learning---Hair-Colour-Prediction-using-Convolutional-Neural-Nets.
Building a Convolutional Neural Network Classifier to predict the hair colour of a celebrity using 200k images from the very well known (**CelebA**) dataset.

**Dataset Description** - *We are using the very famous (**CelebA**) dataset in this project task. The link to the dataset can be found here
[CelebA dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html). The CelebFaces Attributes Dataset(**CelebA**) is a large-scale face attributes
dataset with more than 200K celebrity images, each with 40 attribute notations. This dataset has been preprocessed with a new version that is different
from the orginal dataset in a few aspects such as: Images are relatively large data items, so we've been provided with a cut down version of the dataset
so that it does not cause any problem's with the colab's memory limits. The image size has been cut down to 48 pixels and the number of images provided
are also less in comparison to the number of images that the actual dataset holds. The images labelled with more than one color have also been removed. 
The entire datset provided has been bifurcated into Training, Validation and Test data. As we understand, that our task is a classification task as we have
to correctly classify the labels for each image that we feed to our model within a category/class of `0,1,2,3` denoting hair color 
`['black', 'blond', 'brown', 'gray']` respectively.*
